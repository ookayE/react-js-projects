The checks {fruit && fruit.length > 0} are to ensure that the array fruit is both defined (not null or undefined) and has elements. However, depending on your specific context and how the state is initialized, it may not always be necessary to include both checks.

When Both Checks Are Necessary
When fruit could be null or undefined:
If there's a possibility that fruit could be null or undefined at any point (e.g., it's being fetched asynchronously and hasn't been initialized), then you should use both checks to avoid runtime errors.

When fruit.length > 0 Is Sufficient
When fruit is always initialized as an array:
If you initialize fruit as an empty array when defining the state (as in your example), the check fruit.length > 0 is sufficient because an array always has the length property, even if it's empty.
