Establish connection to db (database > index.js)

Define a model with the kind of datatypes you'll be receiving for a form input

API Routes -> add, fetch/get, update, delete

Joi is a powerful JavaScript library used for data validation. It allows you to define and validate data objects, ensuring that incoming data conforms to specific requirements or rules before it's processed or saved.

KEY CONCEPTS:
Client-side state management (useState, useEffect) for controlling form data and blog operations.
Next.js routing (pages, api routes) to serve different parts of the application.
Mongoose and MongoDB for database management and blog storage.
API handling (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods) to interact with the backend and perform CRUD operations.
Form validation using Joi to ensure that only valid blog data is sent to the database.
